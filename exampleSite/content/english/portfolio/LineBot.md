People like to travel around during holidays. When searching for foreign vacation destinations, we often choose places based on our own interests and preferences. During my years of study in Taiwan, I was often asked by my classmates about travel recommendations in my country. Therefore, I would like to design an onlineChatBot that contains the hidden attractions and travel guides of Malaysia recommended by locals. It also includes the major festivals of the three major ethnic groups in Malaysia, so that foreigners can get to know more about Malaysian culture through this LineBot.

## **Project Details**
The user first enters the topic they want to learn about (tourist attractions/festivals) and is directed to next interface.<br>
